# Using .each

Let's try out the enumerator methods we just learned. Refer back to the previous
lesson to help you pass this challenge. Below, we have a
variable,&nbsp;`lunch_menu`, set equal to an array of lunch menu items.

Since you're super hungry and super excited about lunch, use
the&nbsp;`.each`&nbsp;method to enumerate over the array and append
an&nbsp;`"!"`&nbsp;("exclamation mark") to each menu item. You can use
the&nbsp;`<<`&nbsp;("shovel operator") on each menu item string to add
an&nbsp;`"!"`&nbsp;like this:&nbsp;`"pizza" << "!"`.

```
lunch_menu = ["pizza", "sandwich", "sushi", "soup", "salad"]
```

Which piece of code will achieve the desired result?

## Correct

```
lunch_menu.each do |lunch_item|
  lunch_item << "!"
end
```

## Incorrect

```
lunch_menu << "!"
```

## Incorrect

```
lunch_menu.each do |lunch_item|
  "#{lunch_item}!"
end
```

## Incorrect

```
lunch_menu.each do |lunch_item|
```
