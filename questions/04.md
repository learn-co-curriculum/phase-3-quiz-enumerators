# Using delete_if

Below we have a variable,&nbsp;`cats_and_dogs`, set equal to an array of strings
that are either a&nbsp;`"cat"`&nbsp;or a&nbsp;`"dog"`. We all know that cats and
dogs don't get along. Iterate over the array and delete the elements that
represent dogs.

```
cats_and_dogs = ["cat", "cat", "dog", "cat", "dog", "dog"]
```

Which piece of code will achieve the desired result?

## Correct

```
cats_and_dogs.delete_if do |pet|
  pet == "dog"
end
```

## Incorrect

```
cats_and_dogs.delete_if do |pet|
  pet == "cat"
end
```

## Incorrect

```
cats_and_dogs.delete_if do |pet|
  pet == pet
end
```

## Incorrect

```
cats_and_dogs.delete_if do |pet|
  "dog"
end
```
